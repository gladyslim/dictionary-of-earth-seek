The waves have a very long wavelength of up to 100 miles, but their amplitude is typically so low that they can travel beneath ships without being noticed.  Most tsunamis originate in the ocean, but they can be produced in lakes, bays, and rivers.   When they enter shallow water, the energy of the wave begins to drag on the bottom and that slows the front of the wave, while the back of the wave piles up behind it, reaching heights of up to 100 feet.

This office is physically located at NASA's Stennis Space Center. In May 2006, the NASA Shared Services Center began issuing all new grants and cooperative agreements for the Science Mission Directorate. After a phase-in period, NSSC now issues all grants and cooperative agreements for the Agency including SMD and all 10 NASA Centers. Following receipt of a complete award package, including funding, a NSSC grant officer issues the award to the recipient organization. NSSC is also responsible for issuing annual funding continuations for multi-year awards (following receipt and approval of the annual progress report) and for closing out the award (following receipt and approval of the final report). The <a href=\"https://www.nssc.nasa.gov/portal/site/customerservice/menuitem.6cab8e93610fbf7f0a0c69104dd72749/\">NSSC grants home page</a> provides reference information on NASA grants.
